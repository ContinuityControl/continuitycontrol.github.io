## How to Write a Blog Post

* Start a file under /_posts, named YYYY-MM-DD-your-slug-goes-here.md
* Add a block to the top of the file, like this:

````
---
layout: post
title:  "Great Debugging Tricks"
date:   2014-04-18 17:00:00
post_author: Dan Bernier
---
````
    
* Write the rest of your post in markdown.
* To see how it looks, run: `jekyll serve --port 5002 -w` and head over to that host & port.

Lots more info about this is available from [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
