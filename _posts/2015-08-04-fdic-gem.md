title: Look Up Your Bank with the FDIC Gem

excerpt: The FDIC exposed an unpublished JSON API. So we made a ruby gem for it.

Back in February, [ProgrammableWeb posted that the FDIC had switched their BankFind site from ASPX-backed search forms to a JavaScript frontend backed by a JSON API](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/fdic-bank-data-api-available-official-announcement-pending/2015/02/06).

This meant that there's an unpublished JSON endpoint to hit the FDIC and find Financial Institutions.

Recently, we [made a gem that wraps that endpoint](https://rubygems.org/gems/fdic).

Like most APIs that provide data for industries as mature as banking, the terminology can be intimidating to a new-comer. Fortunately, [the FDIC provides a glossary](https://research.fdic.gov/bankfind/glossary.html). Where the field names are old-fashioned or acronym-y, we've taken the liberty of polishing them: "FACode" becomes "supervising_authority", "insuredFrmDt" becomes "insured_from_date", etc.

Here's the [source](https://github.com/ContinuityControl/fdic).

It's pretty easy to use.

The FDIC API lets you find an Institution if you have its FDIC Certificate Number:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
institution = FDIC.find_institution(26588)
#=> FDIC::Institution
{% endhighlight %}

If you don't have the certificate number, you can search for a Bank by name, and get back all matching Banks:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
banks = FDIC.find_bank('Dedicated Community Bank')
#=> [FDIC::Bank, FDIC::Bank, ...]
{% endhighlight %}


Once you have a Bank, you can get its Institution, which has much more data available:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# Bang, because it's another network request
institution = banks.first.find_institution!
{% endhighlight %}

The API also exposes information about an Institution's branches, and its history. You can query both of these on the FDIC module directly, or on the Institution:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
institution.find_branches!
#=> [FDIC::Branch, FDIC::Branch, ...]

FDIC.find_branches(25688)
#=> [FDIC::Branch, FDIC::Branch, ...]

institution.find_history_events!
#=> [FDIC::HistoryEvent, ...]

FDIC.find_history_events('Dedicated Community Bank', 26588)
#=> [FDIC::HistoryEvent, ...]
{% endhighlight %}

Since a Bank knows its certificate number, it can look up its branch and history information, too.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
bank.find_branches!
bank.find_history_events!
{% endhighlight %}

We're working on making it better. The FDIC provides a fair amount of data - we're looking at their enforcement database - and we're considering adding that to this gem, or providing another one.
