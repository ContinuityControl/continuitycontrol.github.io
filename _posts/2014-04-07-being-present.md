At Continuity Control, we're always concerned with being our most productive and happy selves. A few of us have spent some time studying meditation and came across this talk from last year's Burlington Ruby Conf.

[Fighting Burnout: Incorporating Rest Into the Software Development Workflow - Nick Cox - Burlington Ruby 2013](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2621-btvruby2013-fighting-burnout-incorporating-rest-into-the-software-development-workflow)

Here's our takeaways...

* Actively improving our mental state can improve our productivity.
* Micromeditations - in that little bit on down time
  * Focus all your attention on your breath.
  * Take a deep breath in. Hold. Slowly let it out.
  * Unit test? - take a few deep breaths
  * Feature spec? - take ten
* Completely removing context switches can reduce stress quite a bit
* Sleep well, meditate, keep healthy habits (exercise and diet) and you'll be happier and more productive.

Most importantly...
