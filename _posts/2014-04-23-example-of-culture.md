You see lots of these posts about how culture is most-important, with anecdotes

> At first, she explained, the primary focus was testing for humility during the
> hiring process, and they had a checklist to enforce their “no assholes” rule.
> But they quickly realized they needed to do more.  As the company grew, they
> wanted to keep the same GSD (Get Stuff Done) attitude across the company and
> not let their company turn into “just another company.” This was tricky, but
> because the founders and employees were deeply committed to this attitude, they
> developed the following solution: “You can’t complain here,” Tamara explained.
> “If you see something wrong, you must fix it. We say it is a great opportunity
> to come up with a solution, and this is where many of our best programs have
> come from. Anything can be changed. We aren’t victim to anyone. We own the
> culture.”
