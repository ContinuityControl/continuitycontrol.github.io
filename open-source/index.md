At Continuity, we build things with Ruby and Rails, we use lots of Linux tools, we pair program with Vim and wemux. We like open source.

We contribute to open source, too. Our [github organization](https://github.com/ContinuityControl/) has all the projects we've forked and contributed back to.

We even open-source our own software, when we can. We've written rubygems for pulling Financial Institution data from the [FDIC](https://github.com/ContinuityControl/fdic) and the [NCUA](https://github.com/ContinuityControl/ncua), and one for [keeping your data tidy](https://github.com/ContinuityControl/tiny_sweeper).

Many eyes make all bugs shallow, and open source software is made by people. Tigers help.
