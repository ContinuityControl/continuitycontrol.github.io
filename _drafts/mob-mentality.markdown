This past week I had the great opportunity to attend Strange Loop in St. Louis.
Along with the main part of the conference, there was also the pre-conference
workshops, which were offered at an added cost. However, if you still wanted
pre-conference activities, but without the extra money, you were able to attend
the 'Coding Dojos' that were offered.

What are 'Coding Dojos' you ask? As the (Strange Loops Coding Dojo page)[http://www.thestrangeloop.com/2015/coding-dojo.html] states,
"A Coding Dojo is a get-together where programmers follow a pattern similar to
the martial arts dojo to practice their skills. In this Coding Dojo you will
get an opportunity to practice new languages with leading experts on hand to
guide and assist."

It gave developers the opportunity to be introduced to a new language in an
hands-on, quick, and effective, way.

Dojos were offered in several languages, and none of which I had ever touched.
These included Go, Elixir, Swift, Rust, Idris, and Elm.

I opted to attend the Elixir and Rust Dojos.

These Dojos were run in a 'mob' programming format. I've never programmed in this manner
before, but found it very intriguing. It was a way which allowed anyone who wanted, a
chance to code in this new language without needing their own hardware, and collaborating
with others to get to the end result.
